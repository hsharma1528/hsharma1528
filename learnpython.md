## Python Strings:
1. Immutable sequences
2. Can be sliced, indexed or iterated
3. _in_ and _not_ in operators can be used to find an element in a string
4. One line string => ```python a = "Single Line string ' ```
5. Multi line string => ``` ''' Line One 
                              Line Two ''' ```
6. Functions on Strings 
     * Find Length of a string => **len()**  *** escape character (\) not counted
     * **"+"**    => concatenated
     * **"*"**   => replicated
     * **ord()** => codepoint
     * **chr()**  => codepoint to character
     * **list()** => convert list to string
     * **max()**  => character with max codepoint
     * **min()**  => character wint minimum codepoint
     * **index()** => index of giver substring

## String Methods

* capitalize() – changes all string letters to capitals;
* center() – centers the string inside the field of a known length;
* count() – counts the occurrences of a given character;
* join() – joins all items of a tuple/list into one string;
* lower() – converts all the string's letters into lower-case letters;
* lstrip() – removes the white characters from the beginning of the string;
* replace() – replaces a given substring with another;
* rfind() – finds a substring starting from the end of the string;
* rstrip() – removes the trailing white spaces from the end of the string;
* split() – splits the string into a substring using a given delimiter;
* strip() – removes the leading and trailing white spaces;
* swapcase() – swaps the letters' cases (lower to upper and vice versa)
* title() – makes the first letter in each word upper-case;
* upper() – converts all the string's letter into upper-case letters.
